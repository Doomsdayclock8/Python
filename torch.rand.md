### **Key Takeaways**

- **`torch.randn`** generates values based on the normal distribution with a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1.
- Most values are close to the mean (0), and values farther from the mean occur less frequently.
- This behavior is useful for initializing weights in machine learning models where random but centered values are needed.

### Why More Values are Close to the Mean

- In a normal distribution:
    - The probability of a value is highest near the mean.
    - As you move away from the mean, the probability decreases exponentially.
    - This is due to the formula for the normal distribution: f(x)=12πσe−(x−μ)22σ2f(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi} \sigma} e^{-\frac{(x - \mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}} For `torch.randn`, μ=0\mu = 0 and σ=1\sigma = 1, so values closer to 0 have higher probabilities.

### Visualization of the Distribution

If you plot the values generated by `torch.randn`, you'll see the characteristic bell curve:

```python
import torch
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Generate random values
data = torch.randn(10000)

# Plot histogram
plt.hist(data.numpy(), bins=50, density=True)
plt.title("Histogram of torch.randn")
plt.xlabel("Value")
plt.ylabel("Frequency")
plt.show()
```

- Most values will be around 0.
- Values farther from 0 (e.g., -3 or +3) will occur less frequently.

### Practical Example

```python
import torch

# Generate random values
data = torch.randn(10000)

# Check statistics
print(f"Mean: {data.mean().item()}")          # Close to 0
print(f"Standard Deviation: {data.std().item()}")  # Close to 1
```
