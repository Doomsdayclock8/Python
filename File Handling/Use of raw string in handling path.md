The `r` before a string in Python creates a **raw string literal**. It tells Python to interpret the string as-is, without treating backslashes (`\`) as escape characters. This is especially useful when working with file paths or regular expressions.

### Example Without `r`

In a normal string, `\` is treated as the start of an escape sequence:

```python
path = "C:\Users\Tawfique\Thesis\Data_Augmentation\Other Models\AutoDiffusion"

# Python interprets:
# \T = Tab character
# \D = Invalid escape
```

This may cause errors or unintended behavior.

### Example With `r`

The raw string ensures backslashes are not interpreted as escape characters:

```python
path = r"C:\Users\Tawfique\Thesis\Data_Augmentation\Other Models\AutoDiffusion"

# Interpreted as:
# C:\Users\Tawfique\Thesis\Data_Augmentation\Other Models\AutoDiffusion
```

---

### Key Points:

- Use raw strings (`r"string"`) when working with:
    - **File paths**: `r"C:\new_folder\file.txt"`
    - **Regular expressions**: `r"\d+"` for matching digits
- Raw strings cannot end with an odd number of backslashes (`r"C:\"` is invalid).

### Why `r` Is Helpful in File Paths:

Windows file paths use backslashes (`\`) as directory separators, which conflict with escape sequences like `\n` (newline). Using `r` avoids this issue.
