The `__init__` method in Python is a special constructor method automatically called when an object of a class is created. It initializes the object's attributes with the provided arguments and ensures the object is ready for use. 
# Example:
```
class Example: 
	def __init__(self, value): 
		self.value = value # Initialize attribute 
obj = Example(10) # Calls __init__, sets value to 10
```
- The objects of Example class all need an attribute obj.value
- init method ensures that this attribute is initialized for all the objects of that class
- The object may have some other attributes that are generated from value/are random/are constant . they are not placed under init method
